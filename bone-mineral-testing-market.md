<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Mineral Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central DXA</li><li>Peripheral DXA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone mineral testing is essential for assessing bone health and diagnosing osteoporosis. The two primary types are Central DXA and Peripheral DXA. Central DXA measures bone density in critical areas such as the hip and spine, providing comprehensive data for evaluating fracture risk. In contrast, Peripheral DXA focuses on less critical sites, like the forearm or heel, offering a quicker, more portable option for initial screenings. Both methods play vital roles in osteoporosis management and prevention strategies.</p></p>
