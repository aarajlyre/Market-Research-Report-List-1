<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-ablative Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Ablative Fractionated Lasers</li><li>Non-Ablative Non-Fractionated Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-ablative laser market includes two main types: non-ablative fractionated lasers and non-ablative non-fractionated lasers. Non-ablative fractionated lasers deliver energy in a fractionated pattern, targeting specific skin layers while preserving surrounding tissues, which promotes collagen regeneration with minimal downtime. In contrast, non-ablative non-fractionated lasers emit energy uniformly across the skin surface, suitable for broader applications like overall skin tightening and rejuvenation. Both types are popular for treating wrinkles, pigmentation, and improving skin texture without significant recovery time.</p></p>
