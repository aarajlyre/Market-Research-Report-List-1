<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total-etch System</li><li>Self-etch System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental bonding agents market comprises two primary types: total-etch systems and self-etch systems. Total-etch systems involve the application of an etching agent to enamel and dentin, enhancing bonding by creating a micro-retentive surface. These systems provide strong adhesion but require multiple steps. In contrast, self-etch systems combine etching and bonding processes, simplifying application and reducing technique sensitivity. This makes self-etching agents popular among dental professionals seeking efficiency and consistent results, particularly in less complicated procedures.</p></p>
