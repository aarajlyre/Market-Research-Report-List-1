<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Sensing Array Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structured Light</li><li>Time of Flight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D sensing array market primarily encompasses two key technologies: structured light and time of flight (ToF). Structured light projects a known pattern onto a surface and analyzes the deformation to capture depth information, making it ideal for applications like facial recognition and gesture detection. Conversely, time of flight measures the time it takes for emitted light to return after hitting an object, providing precise depth data over longer ranges. Both technologies enhance various sectors, including automotive, gaming, and robotics.</p></p>
