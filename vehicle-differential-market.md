<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Differential</li><li>Limited-Slip Differential</li><li>Locking Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle differential market comprises three primary types: open differentials, limited-slip differentials, and locking differentials. Open differentials distribute torque equally but can lead to traction loss on slippery surfaces. Limited-slip differentials enhance traction by allowing some variance in wheel speeds while transferring power to the wheel with better grip. Locking differentials provide maximum traction by locking both wheels on an axle together, ideal for off-road conditions. These differentials cater to diverse vehicle performance needs across various driving scenarios.</p></p>
