<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open</li><li>Normally Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the car relay market, there are two main types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) relays. Normally Open relays are unenergized in their default state, allowing current to flow only when activated, making them ideal for applications requiring a power-on trigger. Conversely, Normally Closed relays are energized by default, allowing current to flow until activated, useful for safety systems that need to cut power in case of a fault. Understanding these types helps in selecting the right relay for specific automotive applications.</p></p>
